## Starting

### Actual Script
- Go to URL
    - Install WebDriver (probably Chrome Web Driver?)
    - Open tab
    - Go to tennis site url
- Figure out how to get past 2FA
    - Saving the cookies file seems like the most promising approach at the moment
- Select Elements
    - Select SCRC Tennis Courts
    - Navigate to Saturday Element (or Sunday depending?)
    - Check 6pm element
        - if avaiable --> book it
        - if not available -> move on to the next SCRC court (like court 3) and check
        - check for courts 2 to 6 (5 courts total)
- Test the script with different days first -> then test with Cron Jobs scheduling


## Partially Done:

### Crontab Scheduling
- Make the bash script to call script.py
- Put the name of the bash script in the my_crontab.txt file
- Copy my_crontab.txt file into the main crontab file by simply running `crontab my_crontab.txt`

## Done:
- Made selenium test file to check if selenium is installed or not on a user's computer
