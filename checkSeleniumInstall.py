import selenium

print(selenium.__version__)


# Run this file with `python3 -m checkSeleniumInstall.py` in whichever directory the python file is (use cd commands to get to the right place)  
# This should output a selenium version like 4.27.1 if selenium is installed. If selenium is not installed, you will get an import error  
# You can install selenium with pip by doing `python3 -m pip install selenium`
